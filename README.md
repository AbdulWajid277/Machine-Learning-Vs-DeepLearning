# Machine-Learning-Vs-DeepLearning
Working on AI projects has been a transformative experience, allowing me to dive deep into machine learning, NLP, and predictive analytics. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is the significance of high-quality data—model accuracy relies heavily on proper preprocessing and feature selection.

Beyond just building models, I discovered the importance of optimizing them for real-world applications. Deploying AI solutions using cloud platforms like AWS and Docker helped me understand scalability and performance challenges. Additionally, fine-tuning hyperparameters, addressing overfitting, and debugging complex issues strengthened my technical expertise.These projects have also enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of collaboration in AI development. As I continue exploring the latest advancements in the field, I aim to refine my skills and contribute to building innovative, impactful AI solutions.
